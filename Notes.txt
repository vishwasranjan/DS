                                    DATA STRUCTURE
                                    --------------
Data structure is a way to organize data.

Abstract data types(ADTs) :- define data and operation but no implemnetation.

1) List:-
    >Store a given number element of a given data-types
    >Write and modify the element
    >Read a element
    >have a dynamic size

    We cannot achieve these all feature in terms of memory usage and time complexity by array so Linked List came into picture which is 
    having the dynamic size,can insert a ele at any pos or can delete.

    LINKED LIST:-
    ---------------
    Linked list contains a node which is having two filed one is holding the data and the other is holding the address of the other node.

    Node{
        String data;    //store the data
        Node next;  //store the address of the next node
    }

    [1,_]->[2,_]->[3,_]->null
